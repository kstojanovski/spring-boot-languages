# Spring Boot Languages
## Introduction
The question here was whether different languages could be part of a Spring Boot application. That's the main reason this project was created.
## About the project
The different languages are:
* Java
* Kotlin
* Groovy

The source code from the controller placed in the language-dependent folder invokes the code from other language folders.
## Conclusion
Java and Kotlin complement each other bi-directionally, whereas Groovy can only use Java functionalities.
* Java <-> Kotlin
* Java -> Groovy
